            <h3>Diagnostic Literacy Evaluations</h3>
            <p>The diagnostic literacy evaluation is the cornerstone to our students' success. Using data gathered from diagnostic and norm-referenced assessments, we create a customized tutoring program tailored to the unique interests, strengths, and needs of your child.</p>
            <p>We also offer a 15-20 page written report that provides an in-depth analysis of the test results, identifies percentiles, outlines instructional recommendations, and sets targeted goals. Parents use this report to communicate their child's precise needs to teachers and school officials, who might otherwise not know how to help. We are pretty sure you've never seen a report like this one.</p>

            <h3>Tutoring</h3>
            <p>Unlike scripted programs and homework help centers, our specialists systematically address underlying deficits through a multi-sensory, targeted approach to literacy instruction. Instead of subscribing to any one program, we build instruction from the ground up to reflect the unique needs of each child.</p>
            <p>Our literacy tutoring services are offered to students of all ages. We specialize in helping struggling readers, particularly those with dyslexia, fill the gaps and become proficient readers.</p>
