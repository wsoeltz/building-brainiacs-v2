Paul implements his techniques which are proven and research-based in such a way that my son looks forward to his sessions with him! I hear the way Paul speaks with my son and when my son has moments of getting the “sillies” during his session, Paul knows exactly how to give him the space and also get him back to his focus in such a succinct and gentle way, which is all at once impressive and magical.  My son has improved beyond my expectations and even read me three books the other night, on his own, and with no urging from me.</p><p>Paul has been very willing to speak to me when I needed to understand something about my son\'s dyslexia, as well as writing reports to my son\'s school that are beyond thorough and helpful to all involved in my son\'s IEP. Though my son has a lot of support at his school, I believe that it is his sessions with Paul, since the beginning of the school year, that have helped him the most. He has confidence, where last year he had none, he is excited to read, where last year he would ask only that I read to him, and he is thrilled to learn how to put his ideas to paper and write and draw stories, where last year he might attempt it but would not complete the work or hint at any joy in it, and now it’s the first thing he asks to show me.  Homework is still challenging and I wish Paul was here all the time…haha!  However, recently, my son figured out a word problem in his math homework, first reading it out loud to me then looking to his brain and confidence to figure out the answer, which was very encouraging and astounding to me, and I attribute Paul’s technique and care that has made this possible.  My son’s quote about Paul is, “He is helpful decoding words and he is funny!”</p>","fullColumn":false},{"snippet":"Paul found the perfect teacher for my special needs daughter.

Evan “gets her,” and precisely tailors his tutoring so our daughter can maximize her study time. The results speak for themselves: not only did she raise her average to the mid 90s, in her senior year she made the honor roll for the first time. Even better, she was accepted into her first-choice college (her “reach” school).

Thanks to his experience as a third grade teacher, his first interaction with our kids was great and they were immediately comfortable working with him during his initial evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>He offered us a very competitive rate in exchange for multiple hours, so for the past three months he’s been picking our 8 year old twins up at school two afternoons a week, bringing them home for a snack and then spending an hour with each of them working to strengthen their literacy skills.  As an added bonus he also happens to be a gifted musician and spends a little time teaching both of the kids piano as well.</p><p>Paul is quick to respond to email, phone and text messages. He consistently shows up on time at school, safely escorts the kids on their 15 minute commute home, and uses just the right balance of fun and work to keep them engaged and interested.</p><p>He keeps us updated on their progress with detailed emails and has made himself available for calls with the kids’ teachers to share his insights and to coordinate his tutoring with what’s being taught at school.</p><p>We’ve started to notice both of our children having an easier time with the complex vowel sounds they struggled with just weeks before. We’ve also seen a renewed confidence in our dyslexic daughter’s reading, and less spelling and grammar mistakes in our son’s writing.</p><p>Before Paul, we had worked with a tutor through an agency.

D.","status":"Director of NYU Literacy Clinic","htmlContent":"<p>I have known Paul Tryon since November, 2009. I supervised Paul’s clinical practicum in the Literacy Specialist Master’s Program at NYU. In the practicum, I expect the interns to use appropriate assessments and to develop and implement an instructional program for a struggling reader. In essence, it is a culminating experience for our Master’s Language and Literacy Specialist Program that requires students to apply the knowledge acquired from several literacy courses. I first met Paul before the semester began as an applicant for the Georgiou Foundation Work-Study Award. I was a member of the committee who selected him as the recipient for the award, favoring his qualifications over a pool of applicants that included doctoral students. So this semester, I have also supervised his crucial work in the renewal and reorganization of the Georgiou Children’s Library and Resource Center.</p><p>I have been very impressed by the professionalism, initiative and organizational skills that Paul has exhibited. His comments in class, personal responses following each lesson implementation, and his written assignments indicate the kind of reflective practice that I strive to initiate in my work with both pre-service and in-service teachers. Paul’s work in the literacy clinic was exemplary. His insightful analysis of his student’s needs and his instructional responses enabled his tutee to make accelerated progress (one year of progress) in just a few months. He also demonstrated some expert behavior management techniques during his work with this high needs student.</p><p>Paul has been a key player in the renewal and reorganization of the Georgiou Children’s Library and Resource Center. He has single-handedly initiated and implemented a data management system for an international children’s library that previously didn’t even have a paper inventory of contents. He did consult with the NYU Educational Librarian and a retired children’s media center expert, but overall the responsibility for inventorying and cataloguing the contents of the Georgiou Library has fallen on Paul’s shoulders. Paul’s initiative, technology expertise, and conceptual flexibility have transformed a dusty shrine into a literature and curriculum center that is accessible to the faculty and students of Steinhardt’s School of Education and the community.</p><p>Paul\'s instructional competence, caring attitude, and personal willingness to continue learning will benefit the children he teaches and his professional colleagues.  I heartily recommend him.</p>","fullColumn":false},{"snippet":"I am honored to know Paul Tryon, and I know he would be a valuable asset to any educational institution.","name":"Mary Jane Fyffe","status":"Teacher","htmlContent":"<p>I met Paul while working with him last summer teaching Summer Academy.   I worked with him for 3 weeks, and in that short time, I was extremely impressed with how he motivated kids to learn math through music.  Most of the 4th graders who attended this program did not want to be in school over the summer, but by the end of the first day, these kids looked forward to coming back.  Many of the parents commented on how their children were coming home singing the math songs Mr. Tryon taught them.   Another child, who had emotional issues during the school year, and disliked school in general, couldn\'t wait to come back each and every day.  His mother approached the Dean of Students and wanted to know the “magic” we were using in the classroom.  I attribute this “magic” to Paul Tryon.  Paul used his musical talent to create fun and engaging lessons which enabled the students to retain math concepts that were difficult for them during the regular school year.</p><p>After Summer Academy ended, and the new school year started, I invited Paul into my classroom during his winter break.  Again, he inspired my second graders using his musical talent.  He had them singing a song he wrote on addition facts.  Now, my students have automatic recall on their facts due to Paul\'s song.  He created a math CD which I play on a daily basis during snack.  The kids often request this CD to be played when they have free time.</p><p>I am hoping Paul will be teaching Summer Academy again this year, and if he does, I am requesting to work with him again.  I am honored to know Paul Tryon, and I know he would be a valuable asset to any educational institution.</p>","fullColumn":false},{"snippet":"He is recommended completely and without reservation.","name":"Scott Sargent","status":"Teacher","htmlContent":"<p>From the moment Paul entered my classroom, it was obvious to me that he holds the education profession in extremely high regard.  His appearance and personal conduct made him an immediate role model for my pupils, and his eagerness to assist anyone in need endeared him to students and enriched our classroom environment.  He is a “team player” in every sense of the word, and his patience and genuine concern for his students makes him the type of educator we need to have more of in the profession.</p><p>In observing Paul teach, I viewed an organized, respectful, and well-spoken class leader.  Paul was extremely thorough in his lessons, taking great care to reach all members of his audience utilizing a variety of methods (including by playing his guitar!).  Following observations, Paul was willing to embrace all feedback and was excellent at implementing suggestions to improve subsequent lessons.  It was a wonderful opportunity for me to exchange thoughts with someone with fresh ideas, and I was more than happy to selfishly steal some of Paul’s lessons!  He is a strong teacher in command of his subject matter.</p><p>Finally, Paul’s maturity and appropriate sense of humor were something I will greatly miss and will surely enhance any school environment he becomes a part of.  He enters the building each day smiling and prepared to do anything he can to provide his students with an opportunity to achieve, and it is his naturally compassionate nature that makes him a tremendous teacher.</p><p>Driven and focused, talented yet humble, success for Paul Tryon in the field of education is inevitable.  He is recommended completely and without reservation.</p>","fullColumn":false}]}')}}]);
